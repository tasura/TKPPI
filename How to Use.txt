In order to use this script, python, selenium and the chromedriver(included in the folder) must be on your device. 
The chromedriver can operate as long as it is in the same folder as the script, but selenium requires a special method of installation, the steps of which can be found here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#downloading-python-bindings-for-selenium

Afterwards you can run the script with your IDE of choice or via the command shell.
